    "## Redemption Fee Floor\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liquity V2 protocol implements a fixed minimum redemption fee, known as the `REDEMPTION_FEE_FLOOR`, to stop users from exploiting small inaccuracies in oracle-reported prices arising from deviation thresholds. These inaccuracies, called *oracle drift*, typically hover around 0.5% and reflect the difference between an oracle’s price and the true market price. Without this fee, a user could buy ebUSD for $\\$ 1$ on the secondary market and redeem it for up to $\\$ 1.005$ worth of collateral if the oracle undervalues the asset, profiting from the system. The redemption fee floor, set according to each oracle’s configuration, eliminates this exploit and maintains system stability. When multiple oracles are used, these errors can compound, requiring careful adjustment of the fee based on the asset and its oracle setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compounding Effect with Multiple Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "When an asset’s price is derived from two oracles (e.g., LBTC/BTC and BTC/USD), the maximum deviation—or total error—grows due to a compounding effect. This total error is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_{total} = e_1 + e_2 + e_1 \\cdot e_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $e_1$ is the deviation threshold of the first oracle, and $e_2$ is that of the second oracle. These values represent the potential error in each oracle’s price feed.\n",

Conversely, numerous small redemptions, potentially originating from one or a few addresses, could suggest a \"skimming off the top\" strategy, where users repeatedly redeem small amounts to profit from minor price discrepancies between the oracle-reported price and the actual market price. Monitoring multiple small redemptions from a single address (or multiple) may reveal attempts of gaming the system."

    "# Shutdown System Collateral Ratio (SCR)\n",
    "The Shutdown System Collateral Ratio (SCR) is a key safety threshold. When the Total Collateral Ratio (TCR) falls below SCR, the protocol halts all borrowing except for position closures, triggering a market shutdown. Users can then redeem ebUSD for collateral at a rate better than the current oracle price. This protects the system by curbing the creation of new debt and promoting deleveraging when most positions drop below the branch’s Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR). Think of SCR as a last line of defense in a worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, SCR should be set close to the MCR so that the shutdown triggers when most positions are at or below this minimum threshold, prompting forced liquidations to limit potential losses for the protocol. A key consideration is that SCR is immutable, once set it cannot be adjusted after deployment. To future-proof the system, SCR should not exceed the lowest conceivable MCR the protocol might adopt in the future. Keeping consistent with CCR, lets add 4 percentage points to the upper end of each asset's LTV range and set SCR based on this.\n",
